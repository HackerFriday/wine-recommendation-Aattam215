    Project Description:
    - You are incharge of writing a very fast application that will recommend
         a wine to a customer. You will need to open the csv file attached and parse
         through it. Ask the user for basic information (name, age, wine preference (burgandy / white / etc)).
         Once you have the customer information, create an array of the top 10 wines in their preference, 
         then randomly give them one of the wines with all of the associated information about the wine. 
         You can find the link to the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/zhenyulin/whitewinepricerating 

    - If you want to take this to the next level, rewrite this application in python, then use a trained
        supervised or unsupervised machine learning model using tensorFlow. If you get it working, email 
        Damion (daander@clemson.edu)

    - Requirements:
        - Must be written in C. 
        - Must use github to store your code and give damion permission to view it
            (my github is danderson2794)
        - You have programming freedom to do what you want; however, you should implement the
            the topics we discussed. Here's a list to as a reminder: 
                - basic c functions:
                   printf/fprintf
                    scanf/fscanf
                    fileI/O
                    pointers, double pointers, function pointers. 
                    allocating memory 1D/2D malloc and calloc
